# Initiative-Dnd
Simple Android App made in Unity to manage fast Dnd Initiative

It is not intended to save the results. The moment you close the app or minimize it enought to be restarted by your phone, you will lose all.
I designed it just to make auto enemy d20 rolls with Dex modifier and also add the players initiative that they rolled with their real dices.

The background image of the release was made by me under a Creative Commons License.

My code is half spanish-english because this was made in under 2 hours and it is not intended to re-use. Just posting the code of the scripts I made.

Enjoy.
